      But we’ve met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St.
      Swithin’s, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It’s an
      orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don’t
      remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt.
      Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels
      like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters
      parents. Everybody understands, for a while.<button>

      >Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can’t do,
      move on. After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to
      a boy’s home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger,
      and practice smiling in the mirror. It’s like putting on a mask. So you
      showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so
      excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up stories
      about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that’s all it
      was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were.
      I’d seen that look on your face before. It’s the same one I taught myself.
      I don’t why you took the fault for Dent’s murder but I’m still a believer
      in the Batman. Even if you’re not…
